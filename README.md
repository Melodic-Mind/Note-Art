## About :notes:

* This project aims to create the ultimate music library, including:
   * Music Theory
   * Music Notation
   * Instruments
   * Scheduling and playing Music(using [Tone JS](https://tonejs.github.io/))
   * Audio Feature Extraction(Not implemented yet)

* Designed to be simple and intuitive.
* Use this library to create tools for musicians, research music theory, just create some fun music with programming and much more! 

## Features
1. Create Notes, Chords, Scales and more, and extract information from them.
2. Create full musical pieces with multiple instruments.
3. Play music right away using built in Instruments (or easily create your own).

## Getting Started
To Start create a new node project(or go to an existing one).
<br>install note-art -
``` bash
npm install note-art
```

### Usage
```
import {Note, Chord, Scale} from 'note-art'

// Note

const A = new Note(note: 'a', octave: 4)

console.log(A)      // A4

console.log(A.frequency) // outputs 440

const fourth = A.interval(5) // fourth is the note E with octave 5

console.log(fourth) // E4

//Chord

const A_M = new Chord({note: A, name: 'Major'})

console.log(A_M.pitchClasses) // A4, C5, E5

//Scale

const C_Major = new Scale({tonic: new Note('c', 3), name: 'Major'})

console.log(A_Major.notesString) // C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, A3, B3
```

## Todo:
* Create base music models - pitch class, note, chord, etc... :heavy_check_mark: 

* Create instrument models that can play notes.                :heavy_check_mark:
* Implement Music notation. :heavy_check_mark: 
* Create scheduling and automation for playing music pieces with an arbitrary instrument. :heavy_check_mark: 
* Add static and dynamic audio feature extraction.
* Add more instruments.
