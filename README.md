###### *A Work in progress*
# Note-Art JS
* Music is a highly versatile art that originates in nature, and has been taken up by mankind as a way of expression and also as an art.
Now, it's going to be taken up by machines as well.

* This project aims to create a library that implements all of music theory(in all it's forms) in code,
can be used to play sounds of most musical instruments.
It will then be used to create multiple tools for people to practice, learn, enjoy and compose.
it will also be used to attempt development of different projects combining music and AI.
